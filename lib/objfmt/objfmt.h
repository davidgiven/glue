/***********************************************************************
 * PROJECT:	  PCGEOS
 * MODULE:	  Swat/Esp/Glue -- interface definitions
 * FILE:	  objformat.h
 *
 * AUTHOR:  	  Adam de Boor: June 13, 1989
 *
 * REVISION HISTORY:
 *	Date	  Name	    Description
 *	----	  ----	    -----------
 *	6/13/89	  ardeb	    Initial version
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *	Definitions for the interface between Esp, Glue and Swat.
 *	These definitions govern two types of files: .obj (relocatable
 *	object files, as produced by Esp) and .sym (symbol files, as produced
 *	by Glue. The two files are essentially the same, except the .sym
 *	file contains no object code -- just symbols.
 *
 *	All binary things, other than the object code itself, are written
 *	in the byte-order of the creating machine. The byte-order is recorded
 *	in the header of the file and is dealt with by Glue and Swat,
 *	if the file is taken to a machine with a different byte-order.
 *	More things are in binary than I'd originally intended, as I
 *	decided the taking of a binary from one byte-order machine to
 *	another would be relatively infrequent.
 *
 *	There are several goals for this file format:
 *	    - Compact
 *	    - Easy to generate
 *	    - Fast to link
 *	    - Symbol table must be modular so Swat can read it in in pieces
 *	    - Similar (if not identical) to OS90 VM file to allow
 *	      easy conversion, or simple copying, to the OS90 debug
 *	      environment, when it gets going.
 *
 *	Due to the segmented architecture, the file itself is segmented.
